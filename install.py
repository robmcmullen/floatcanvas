'''!
   A script that installs the floatcanvas package in the wxPython lib It
   also installs the demo into the wxPython demo directory, if you set
   the path for that correctly.
   
   CB -- Now use the os.path module to make the install script OS independent.
   
   Issues:
   - SVN's folder .svn doesn't delete with shutil.
   - Demo folder must be hard coded.
